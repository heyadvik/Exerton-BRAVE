## 1. Purpose; Basic Deal

Investor delivers the Purchase Amount to Founder. If Founder forms (or causes to be formed) a qualifying company (the "Company") within the Incorporation Deadline to commercialize the Project (defined in Schedule 1), this SAFE will convert into equity of the Company on the terms below. Until assignment to a Company, Founder remains personally bound as provided herein.

## 2. Use of Funds

Founder will use the Purchase Amount only for:
- (a) Project development and commercialization;
- (b) incorporation and legal costs;
- (c) reasonable living expenses that directly support full-time work on the Project (not to exceed 30% of Purchase Amount without Investor consent);
- (d) other business uses reasonably related to the Project.

## 3. Definitions (selected)

**Project:** the product/prototype/IP/business described in Schedule 1.

**Future Company:** any for-profit legal entity formed or controlled by Founder within the Scope Period that commercializes or is substantially derived from the Project.

**Equity Financing:** the Company's first bona-fide sale of Preferred Stock (or similar) to outside investors (not employees/advisors/Founder), raising at least $500,000 in new money.

**Safe Price:** the Valuation Cap divided by the Company Capitalization, as defined below.

**Liquidity Event:** a Change of Control or IPO.

**Change of Control:** (i) a merger or consolidation where the Company's stockholders immediately prior to the transaction do not own a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity, or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.

**IPO:** the closing of the Company's first firm-commitment underwritten public offering of its Common Stock on a major exchange registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

**Company Capitalization:** the number of shares of the Company's capital stock (on an as-converted to common stock basis) outstanding immediately prior to the Equity Financing or Liquidity Event, including all shares reserved and issuable under any equity incentive plan and upon conversion of all outstanding convertible securities, provided that Company Capitalization shall exclude securities issuable upon conversion of this SAFE and other contemporaneous pre-incorporation SAFEs executed by Founder or on Founder's behalf.

## 4. Person-First Scope; Notice

### 4.1 Person-First Rule
This SAFE is attached to Founder and will convert into Company equity if, within the Scope Period, a Future Company (a) is formed primarily to commercialize the Project, (b) acquires the Project as a material part of its business, or (c) is substantially derived from the Project.

### 4.2 Notification
Founder will notify Investor in writing within ten (10) days of forming any Future Company and will deliver the documents listed in Schedule 2.

### 4.3 Assignment & Assumption; Post-Incorporation Instrument
Upon formation, Founder will cause the Company to execute the Assignment & Assumption (Exhibit A) and to issue the post-incorporation instrument described in Exhibit B within 30 days of the Company's formation or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable.

## 5. Reporting

While outstanding, Founder will provide a short written progress report every 90 days: milestones, brief use-of-funds summary, material developments, and estimated incorporation timeline. Failure to deliver a report after 10 days' written notice gives Investor the right to request cure; Investor will not use failure to report as sole basis for acceleration absent material misconduct.

## 6. Conversion (Equity Financing)

### 6.1 Conversion Price — clarified
For purposes of conversion, "Conversion Price" means the lesser of (a) the price per share paid by the investors in the Equity Financing; or (b) the Safe Price (Valuation Cap ÷ Company Capitalization).

### 6.2 Automatic Conversion
On the closing of an Equity Financing, this SAFE shall automatically convert into the number of shares of the class of securities sold in that Equity Financing equal to:

**Number of Shares = Purchase Amount ÷ Conversion Price**

### 6.3 Treatment on Conversion
The shares issued on conversion shall have the same rights, preferences and privileges as the securities sold in the Equity Financing on an as-converted basis. Conversion shall be automatic and require no further action by Investor or Founder, subject to customary ministerial steps.

## 7. Conversion (Liquidity Event)

### 7.1 Conversion on Liquidity Event
If a Liquidity Event occurs prior to an Equity Financing and after a Company has been formed and assumed this SAFE, this SAFE will convert into shares of Common Stock at the Safe Price immediately prior to the Liquidity Event, and Investor will receive the same form of consideration per share as other holders of Common Stock.

### 7.2 Cash Election
Upon a Liquidity Event, Investor may elect within 30 days after written notice to receive either (a) the amount Investor would receive upon conversion under Section 7.1, or (b) a cash payment equal to the Purchase Amount. If Investor does not timely elect, the option yielding the greater cash value to Investor as reasonably determined by the Company's board (in good faith) will be deemed elected.

## 8. Dissolution / No Qualified Company

### 8.1 Termination
If no Future Company is formed and assumes this instrument within the Scope Period, this SAFE will terminate and have no further effect.

### 8.2 Asset Transfer
If, prior to incorporation, Founder ceases active work on the Project or transfers all or substantially all of the Project's assets to a third party that is not a Future Company (an "Asset Transfer"), Founder shall promptly notify Investor. The Investor may then, within 30 days of such notice, elect either to: (a) receive a repayment of the Purchase Amount from the proceeds of the Asset Transfer (on a pro rata basis based on the percentage of Project assets transferred); or (b) continue to have this SAFE remain outstanding, attached to the Founder, for the remainder of the Scope Period. Any repayment under Section 8.2(a) is subordinate to third-party creditors and payable only from available proceeds of the Asset Transfer.

## 9. Founder Representations & Survival

Founder represents and warrants to Investor that: (a) Founder has full power and authority to execute this SAFE and to develop the Project; (b) to Founder's knowledge the Project is original work of Founder and does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights; and (c) Founder is not aware of any material legal claims or disputes regarding the Project. These representations survive assignment to the Company only as to pre-assignment matters.

## 10. Investor Representations; KYC / AML / Tax Cooperation

### 10.1 Investor Reps
Investor represents that Investor is acquiring this SAFE for investment for Investor's own account and not with a view to distribution, and that Investor will comply with applicable securities, tax and other laws.

### 10.2 KYC/AML; Tax Cooperation
Each party will comply with all applicable KYC/AML, sanctions and tax reporting rules. Investor agrees to provide reasonable identification, tax and other information reasonably requested by Founder, Company (upon assumption) or the Platform to satisfy regulatory and tax requirements.

## 11. Assignment; Effect of Assignment (Exhibit A)

Upon the Company's execution of the Assignment & Assumption in the form attached as Exhibit A, the Company shall be substituted as the primary obligor for all obligations assumed under this SAFE. Founder shall be released from obligations assumed by the Company under the Assignment & Assumption, except that Founder's representations and warranties made in this SAFE that relate to pre-assignment facts shall survive as set forth herein.

## 12. General Provisions

**Governing Law:** Delaware.

**Entire Agreement:** This SAFE (with Exhibits and Schedules) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

**Successors and Assigns:** Investor may assign this SAFE to an affiliate or pursuant to a sale; Founder may not assign without Investor consent except as part of the Assignment & Assumption provided in Exhibit A.

**Notices:** Notices shall be in writing and delivered to the addresses set forth above (or such other address as a party may designate in writing). Email notice shall be effective upon receipt.

**No equity or debt claim until conversion:** This SAFE does not constitute debt of the Founder or Company (except as expressly provided in limited Asset Transfer repayment scenarios) and does not give Investor rights as a creditor until conversion as provided herein.

**Attorneys' Fees:** If a party substantially prevails in any enforcement action arising under this SAFE, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
