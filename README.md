# BRAVE: Person-First Pre-Incorporation Safe

> **BRAVE lets people invest in people, not entities.**

BRAVE (Backing Rights For Anticipated Venture Equity) is a pre-incorporation SAFE instrument that enables investors to back founders and ideas before formal company structures exist. Created by Exerton, BRAVE transforms early-stage investment by focusing on pushing human potential to the edge. 

## What is BRAVE?

BRAVE is a legal instrument that allows:
- **Investors** to invest in founders before they incorporate
- **Founders** to receive funding while maintaining flexibility on incorporation timing
- **Both parties** to establish equity arrangements that automatically convert when a company is formed

## Key Features

### Person-First Investment
- Investment is tied to the **founder**, not an entity
- Founder has up to 5 years to incorporate
- SAFW automatically converts when a qualifying company is formed

### Flexible Incorporation
- No pressure to incorporate immediately
- Founder can focus on product development first
- Built-in protections for both investor and founder

### Automatic Conversion
- Seamlessly converts to standard post-money safe upon incorporation
- Uses valuation cap methodology for fair conversion
- Includes liquidity event protections

## How It Works

1. **Investment**: Investor provides funding to founder using BRAVE instrument
2. **Development**: Founder uses funds for project development, living expenses, and business needs
3. **Incorporation**: When founder incorporates (within 5 years), BRAVE converts to company equity
4. **Conversion**: Instrument automatically becomes a standard Y Combinator-style post-money safe

## Key Terms

- **Scope Period**: 5 years from effective date
- **Use of Funds**: Project development, incorporation costs, reasonable living expenses (up to 30%)
- **Reporting**: Quarterly progress updates required
- **Conversion**: Automatic upon equity financing or liquidity event

## Legal Structure

### Pre-Incorporation Phase
- Founder personally bound by instrument
- Funds restricted to specified uses

### Post-Incorporation Phase  
- Company assumes all obligations via Assignment & Assumption
- Converts to standard post-money safe
- Founder released from personal obligations
